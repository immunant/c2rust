Do not add any comments that are not present in the C function.
Use Rust doc comment syntax (///) where appropriate (e.g., for function documentation).
Respond with the Rust function definition with the transferred comments.

The Rust must contain exactly the same comments as the C code did.
This must be true even if there are C comments in conditionally-compiled code
not present in the Rust, including comments on preprocessor directives.
In such cases, insert the C comment (only the comment, not any C code)
into the Rust where the Rust code should have been.
If any C comments are not inserted into the Rust, explain why.

C function:
```c
void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{

        /* pi is the partitioning index; arr[pi] is now at the right place */
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
