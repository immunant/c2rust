Do not add any comments that are not present in the C function.
Use Rust doc comment syntax (///) where appropriate (e.g., for function documentation).
Respond with the Rust function definition with the transferred comments.

The Rust must contain exactly the same comments as the C code did.
This must be true even if there are C comments in conditionally-compiled code
not present in the Rust, including comments on preprocessor directives.
In such cases, insert the C comment (only the comment, not any C code)
into the Rust where the Rust code should have been.
If any C comments are not inserted into the Rust, explain why.

C function:
```c
// backwards compatible "format and write to file" function

int json_object_to_file(const char *filename, struct json_object *obj)
{
  return json_object_to_file_ext(filename, obj, JSON_C_TO_STRING_PLAIN);
}```

Rust function:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
#[c2rust::src_loc = "186:1"]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn json_object_to_file(
