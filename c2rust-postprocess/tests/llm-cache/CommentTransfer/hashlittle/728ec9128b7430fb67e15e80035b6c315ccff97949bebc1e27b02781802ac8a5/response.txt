            mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.

            This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
            still in (a,b,c) after mix().

            If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
            mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
            are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
            This was tested for:
            * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
              of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
              (a,b,c).
            * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
              the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
              is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
              difference.
            * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
              all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.

            Some k values for my "a-=c; a^=rot(c,k); c+=b;" arrangement that
            satisfy this are
                4  6  8 16 19  4
                9 15  3 18 27 15
               14  9  3  7 17  3
            Well, "9 15 3 18 27 15" didn't quite get 32 bits diffing
            for "differ" defined as + with a one-bit base and a two-bit delta.  I
            used http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html to choose
            the operations, constants, and arrangements of the variables.

            This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
            that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
            most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
            avalanche in c.

            This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
            the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
            direction as the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
            seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands
            on, and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used
            rotates.

    final -- final mixing of 3 32-bit values (a,b,c) into c

    Pairs of (a,b,c) values differing in only a few bits will usually
    produce values of c that look totally different.  This was tested for
    * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
      of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
      (a,b,c).
    * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
      the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
      is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
      difference.
    * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
      all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.

    These constants passed:
     14 11 25 16 4 14 24
     12 14 25 16 4 14 24
    and these came close:
      4  8 15 26 3 22 24
     10  8 15 26 3 22 24
     11  8 15 26 3 22 24
