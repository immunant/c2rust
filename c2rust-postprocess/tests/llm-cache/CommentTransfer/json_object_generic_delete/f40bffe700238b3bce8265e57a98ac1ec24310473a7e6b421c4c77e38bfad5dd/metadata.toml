Do not add any comments that are not present in the C function.
Use Rust doc comment syntax (///) where appropriate (e.g., for function documentation).
Respond with the Rust function definition with the transferred comments.

The Rust must contain exactly the same comments as the C code did.
This must be true even if there are C comments in conditionally-compiled code
not present in the Rust, including comments on preprocessor directives.
In such cases, insert the C comment (only the comment, not any C code)
into the Rust where the Rust code should have been.
If any C comments are not inserted into the Rust, explain why.

C function:
```c
/* generic object construction and destruction parts */

static void json_object_generic_delete(struct json_object* jso)
{
#ifdef REFCOUNT_DEBUG
\tMC_DEBUG("json_object_delete_%s: %p\\n",
\t   json_type_to_name(jso->o_type), jso);
\tlh_table_delete(json_object_table, jso);
#endif /* REFCOUNT_DEBUG */
\tprintbuf_free(jso->_pb);
\tfree(jso);
}```

Rust function:
```rust
#[c2rust::src_loc = "215:1"]
