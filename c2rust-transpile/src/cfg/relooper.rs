//! This module contains the relooper algorithm for creating structured control
//! flow from a CFG.
//!
//! Relooper is an algorithm for converting an arbitrary, unstructured
//! control-flow graph (CFG) into the structured control-flow constructs
//! available in Rust. The original relooper algorithm was described in the
//! [Emscripten paper][emscripten], which describes converting a CFG into
//! JavaScript's structured control-flow constructs. The implementation of
//! relooper used here is based on the original algorithm, with the addition of
//! some heuristics and Rust-specific control-flow constructs.
//!
//! [emscripten]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2048147.2048224
//!
//! # Terminology
//!
//! The terms "label", "block", and "node" are sometimes used interchangeably in
//! this file. A label is the unique identifier for a block, and a block is a
//! node in the control-flow graph. In some cases we're working directly with
//! the basic blocks, but in many places when working with the CFG we're dealing
//! only with labels, and the blocks themselves are secondary.
//!
//! # Relooper Algorithm
//!
//! The relooper algorithm works by recursively breaking down sections of the
//! CFG into structured control-flow constructs, partitioning blocks into either
//! `Simple` structures, `Loop` structures, or `Multiple` structures. At each
//! step, we start with a set of basic blocks and information about which of
//! those blocks act as entry points to this portion of the CFG. We then look
//! for ways to break down the CFG into smaller sections that can be represented
//! using structured control-flow constructs.
//!
//! If we have a single entry point, and there are no back edges to that entry,
//! then we can generate a simple structure. `Simple` structures contain a
//! single basic block, and represent a straight-line sequence of instructions.
//! All remaining blocks are then recursively relooped, with the immediate
//! successors of the entry becoming the new entries for the rest of that
//! portion of the CFG.
//!
//! If we have entries with back edges to them, then we can generate a `Loop`
//! structure. Any nodes that can reach the entry become part of the loop body,
//! with any remaining nodes becoming the follow blocks for the loop. The loop's
//! contents are then relooped into the loops's body, and the follow blocks get
//! relooped to be the logic that follows the loop.
//!
//! If we have more than one entry, then we can generate a `Multiple` structure.
//! These are effectively `match` statements, with each entry becoming an arm of
//! the `match`. Blocks that are only reachable by one of the entries (including
//! the entry itself) become the body blocks for that arm of the multiple, and
//! any blocks reachable from more than one entry become the follow blocks. We
//! then recursively reloop each of the branches of the multiple, and then
//! reloop the follow blocks.
//!
//! Note that there are a lot of subtleties to how we choose to partition blocks
//! into these structures. The logic in the relooper implementation contains
//! thorough comments describing what we're doing at each step and why we are
//! making the choices that we do. This module documentation covers some of
//! them, but you'll need to read through the full algorithm to get all of the
//! nuances.
//!
//! # Heuristics
//!
//! When reconstructing structured control flow from a CFG, there are often
//! multiple valid ways to structure the graph. In order to produce Rust code
//! that is as similar to the original C as possible, we have a couple of
//! heuristics that use information from the original C code to guide the
//! restructuring process.
//!
//! Before creating a loop, we first try to match a `Multiple` from the original
//! C. During transpilation we preserve information about where there are
//! branches in the C code along with which CFG nodes are part of those
//! branches, which we can then look up based on the current set of entries. If
//! we find that there is a `Multiple` in the original C that matches our
//! current entries, and the structure of the CFG allows it, we can reproduce
//! the control-flow from the original C. Doing this before creating a loop
//! helps in cases where we have branches with multiple disjoint loops, since
//! the loop analysis does not recognize disjoint loops and will always produce
//! a single loop with a `Multiple` inside of it handling the bodies of what
//! should be separate loops.
//!
//! When creating loops, we also make use of a similar heuristic that tries to
//! recreate the loops that we see in the original C. When partitioning blocks
//! into the loop's body, we first attempt to match an existing loop from the
//! original C. Failing that, we fall back on a heuristic that tries to keep as
//! many blocks as possible in the loop's body, even if they don't strictly
//! belong there according to the original C structure.
//!
//! # Simplification
//!
//! After the relooper algorithm runs, we have an optional simplification pass
//! that attempts to reduce the complexity of the generated control flow
//! structures. This pass can help to eliminate unnecessary nesting and make the
//! final output more readable. It applies two main simplifications:
//!
//! - Merge cases in [`Switch`] terminators if they target the same label. That
//!   means instead of having `1 => goto A, 2 => goto A, 3 => goto B`, we
//!   instead get `1 | 2 => goto A, 3 => goto B`.
//! - Inline `Multiple` structures into preceding `Simple` structures. When a
//!   `Simple` structure with a `Switch` terminator is immediately followed by a
//!   `Multiple`, the branches from the `Multiple` are inlined directly into the
//!   `Switch` cases as `Nested` structures, eliminating the intermediate
//!   `Multiple` and reducing nesting depth.
