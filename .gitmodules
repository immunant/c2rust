# The `update = none`s are to avoid cargo cloning
# all submodules for git dependencies on c2rust.
# It's unclear if cargo should be doing this
# (see <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4247>),
# but it is right now, so `update = none` is the only workaround
# (see <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10717>).
# This means that other users of submodules need to update them manually:
# `git submodule update --init --checkout`.
