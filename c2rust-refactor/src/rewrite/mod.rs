//! Module for rewriting source text to reflect changes in the AST.
//!
//! Rewriting takes as input an old AST, a new AST, and source text that parses to the old AST, and
//! transforms that source text into text that parses to the new AST.  Rewriting is designed to
//! preserve comments and whitespace whenever possible.
//!
//! At a high level, rewriting is a recursive traversal on the old and new ASTs.  Everywhere the
//! two are equal, there is no work to do.  But where they differ, it applies a number of "rewrite
//! strategies" that attempt to turn the old text into new text.  In cases where no strategy can
//! perform the rewrite, it propagates the error upward, trying the available strategies to rewrite
//! enclosing nodes of the ASTs.
//!
//! The core of the actual implementation is the `Rewrite::rewrite(old, new, rcx) -> bool` method,
//! which attempts to rewrite the `old` AST into the `new` AST.  The implementation of this method
//! for each node type simply tries each applicable strategy for the node type until either one of
//! the strategies succeeds or it runs out of strategies to try.  `Rewrite::rewrite` is not
//! (directly) recursive - the recursive traversal is handled by the `recursive` strategy.
//!
//! There are three core rewrite strategies:
//!
//!  * `equal`: If the two nodes are equal, rewriting succeeds.  If they aren't, it fails.  In
//!    either case, this strategy performs no actual rewrites.
//!
//!    For leaf nodes, this strategy is tried first.
//!
//!  * `recursive`: If every child of the first can be rewritten to the corresponding child of the
//!    second, then rewriting succeeds.  For nodes of enum type, the two nodes must be instances of
//!    the same variant (otherwise there would be no correspondence between the old and new nodes'
//!    children).  If the variants are unequal or rewriting of any child fails, then the overall
//!    rewrite fails.  This strategy performs no rewrites beyond those performed by its recursive
//!    calls.
//!
//!    This is where the recursion happens in the actual implementation.  Since it implements a
//!    superset of `equal`'s functionality, it replaces `equal` as the first strategy to try for
//!    all non-leaf node types.
//!
//!  * `print`: Pretty-prints the new node, and performs a rewrite to replace the old source with
//!    this new source text.  This strategy always succeeds, but is only implemented for a few node
//!    types (mostly major ones such as `Item`, `Expr`, etc).
//!
//!    Since pretty-printer's output is cosmetically quite bad (it includes no comments, prints
//!    macros in expanded form, and sometimes makes questionable decisions regarding whitespace),
//!    the `print` strategy tries to replace pretty-printer output with original (user-written)
//!    source text whenever possible.  See the `rewrite::strategy::print` module docs for details.
//!
//!    Since this strategy always succeeds, but often produces bad results, it is tried last for
//!    any node types that support it.
//!
//! Since `print` and the more specialized (non-core) strategies only work for a small set of node
//! types, for most nodes `Rewrite::rewrite` simply tries `equal` (leaf nodes) or `recursive`
//! (non-leaf nodes), and fails if the strategy fails.  This failure will cause a failure in the
//! enclosing `recursive`, and will propagate upward until it reaches a node type that actually
//! does support another strategy, such as `Item`.  This is the point where rewriting actually
//! happens: when `recursive` fails, `Rewrite::rewrite` will try the next strategy (such as
//! `print`), which can perform rewrites to correct the error at this higher level.
